				What is Munch?
			</h2>
			<p>
				A new platform for posting and catching great food deals at local 
				restaurants! Just another deals site you might think... but we are not! 
				Munch has the mission of giving total control to restaurant owners 
				and customers. 
			</p>
			<p>
				<strong>For Customers</strong> control how close (mile radius) 
				a restaurant needs to be in order to let you know about their deals. 
				Get special offers by following you favorite restaurants. If it is on Munch
				it is valid! No more <i>"we can't take that coupon"</i>. And the best part,
				search and redemption of deals are free!
			</p>
			<p>
				<strong>For Restaurant Owners</strong> pay per posting; we don't want to 
				put a tax on your income. Also, Munch helps you track the effect of your 
				deal and gives you total control to modify on-the-run to maximize the 
				benefits for your business.
